hundred ninety two\nA gob from Italy\nWent wandering through the streets of Spain\nA pissing in the alley.\n\nCHORUS:\nHe swung his balls around-o,\nThey nearly touched the ground-o,\nThat masturbating, fornicating\nSon-of-a-bitch, Columbo.\n\nIn fourteen hundred ninety two\nThe expedition started.\nQueen Isabel, she cried like hell,\nColumbo only farted.\n\nAboard the good ship Venus,\nBy God, you should have seen us,\nThe figurehead, a whore in bed,\nThe mast a throbbing penis.\n\nPART THE SECOND\nIn which we learn more of the brave explorer.\n\nColumbo paced upon the deck,\nHe knew it was his duty.\nHe laid this whang into his hand\nAnd said, \"Ain't that a beauty.\"\n\nThe sailors on Columbo's ship\nHad each his private knothole.\nBut Columbo was a superman\nAnd used a padded porthole.\n\nColumbo had a one-eyed cat,\nHe kept it in the cabin.\nHe rubbed its ass with axle grease\nAnd started in a jabbin'.\n\nColumbo had a cabin boy,\nThat dirty little nipper!\nThey lined his ass with broken glass\nAnd circumcised the skipper.\n\nPART THE THIRD\nIn which we are introduced to the crew of the Venus and learn about some of their singular accomplishments.\n\nColumbo had a first mate,\nHe loved him like a brother;\nEvery night in the pale moonlight\nThey buggered one another.\n\nThe second mate's name was Andy,\nBy God he had a dandy,\nThey crushed his cock between two rocks\nFor shooting in the brandy.\n\nThe first cook's name was Carter,\nA very musical farter;\nHe could fart anything from God Save the King\nTo Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata.\n\nThe bo's'ns mate fell overboard,\nThe sharks did leap and frolic.\nHim they ate with relish great\nBut shortly died of colic.\n\nPART THE FOURTH\nConcerning what the sailors did for recreation and how it came that Columbo�s daughter was lost at sea and what became of her.\n\nThe skipper's daughter Mabel\nThey fucked when they were able.\nThey tacked her tits, those homely shits,\nRight to the galley table.\n\nThe skipper's other daughter\nThey threw into the water.\nDelighted squeals revealed the eels\nHad found her sexual quarter.\n\nPART THE FIFTH\nIn which the New World is at last discovered; and how the sailors expressed their joy at finding civilization.\n\nFor forty days and forty nights\nThey sailed the broad Atlantic.\nColumbo and his lousy crew\nFor want of a piece were frantic.\n\nThey spied a whore upon the shore\nAnd off came shirts and collars,\nIn twenty minutes by the clock\nShe'd made then thousand dollars.\n\nWith a joyful shout they ran about\nAnd practiced fornication,\nWhen they sailed they left behind\nTen times the population.\n\nAnd when his men pulled out again\nTo take the homeward tour up,\nThey'd caught the pox from every box\nThat syphilized all Europe.\n\nPART THE SIXTH\nIn which Columbo at last returns to Spain, and how he delivers this plunder to the Queen, and the sad fate he gets for so doing.\n\nColumbo went in haste to the Queen\nBecause it was his duty,\nHe gave to her a dose of clap;\nHe had no other booty.\n\nSo they threw in a stinking jail\nAnd left him there to grumble,\nA ball and chain tied to his balls -\nSo ended poor Columbo.","slug":"columbo","tune":"Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Boys"},"come-sit-on-my-face-if-you-love-me":{"title":"Come Sit on My Face if You Love

drink,\nAnd a tale to you I'll tell,\nOf Dead-eye Dick and Mexican Pete,\nAnd harlot called Eskimo Nell.\n\nWhen Dead-eye Dick and Mexican Pete,\nGo forth in search of fun,\nIt's Dead-eye Dick that slings the prick,\nAnd Mexican Pete the gun.\n\nWhen Dead-eye Dick and Mexican Pete,\nAre sore, depressed and sad,\nIt's always a cunt that bears the brunt,\nBut the shooting ain't so bad.\n\nNow Dead-eye Dick and Mexican Pete,\nLived down by Dead Man's Creek,\nAnd such was their luck that they'd had no fuck,\nFor nigh on half a week.\n\nJust a moose or two and a caribou,\nAnd a bison cow or so,\nAnd for Dead-eye Dick with his kingly prick,\nThis was mighty slow.\n\nSo do or dare, this horny pair,\nSet forth for the Rio Grande.\nDead-eye Dick with his might prick,\nAnd Pete with his gun in his hand.\n\nAnd as they blazed their noisy trail,\nNo man their path withstood,\nAnd many a bride, her husband's pride,\nA pregnant widow now stood.\n\nThey reached the sand of the Rio Grande,\nAt the height of the blazing noon,\nAnd to slack the thirst and do their worst,\nThey sought Black Mike's Saloon.\n\nAnd as they pushed the great doors wide,\nBoth prick and gun flashed free,\n\"According to sex, you bleeding wrecks,\nYou'll fuck or you'll drink with me.\n\nThey'd heard of the prick of Dead-eye Dick,\nFrom Main to Panama,\nAnd with scarcely worse that a muttered curse,\nThose Dingoes sought the bar.\n\nThe girls too know his playful ways,\nDown on the Rio Grande,\nAnd forty whores pulled down their drawers,\nAt Dead-eye Dick's command.\n\nThey saw the fingers of Mexican Pete,\nItch on the trigger grip,\nAnd they didn't wait at a fearful rate,\nThose whores began to strip.\n\nNow Dead-eye Dick was breathing quick,\nWith lecherous snorts and grunts,\nAs forty arses were bared to view,\nAnd likewise forty cunts.\n\nNow forty arses and forty cunts,\nIf you can use your wits,\nAnd if you're slick at arithmetic,\nMakes exactly eighty tits.\n\nNow eighty tits are a gladsome sight,\nFor a man with a raging stand,\nIt may be rare in Berkeley Square,\nBut not on the Rio Grande.\n\nNow Dead-eye Dick had fucked a few,\nOn the last preceding night,\nThis he had done just to show his fun,\nAnd to whet his appetite.\n\nHis phallic limb was in fucking trim,\nAs he backed and took a run,\nHe made a dart at the nearest tart,\nAnd scored a hole in one.\n\nHe bore this whore to the sandy floor,\nAnd there he ground her fine,\nAnd though she grinned, it put the wind,\nUp the other thirty nine.\n\nWhen Dead-eye Dick lets loose his prick,\nHe's got no time to spare,\nFor speed and length combined with strength,\nHe fairly singes hair.\n\nHe made a dart at the next spare tart,\nWhen into that Harlot's Hell,\nStrode a gentle maid who was unafraid,\nAnd her name was Eskimo Nell.\n\nBy this time Dick had got his prick,\nWell into number two,\nWhen Eskimo Nell let out a yell,\nShe bawled to him: \"Hey, you!\"\n\nHe gave a flick of his muscular prick,\nAnd the girl flew over his head,\nAnd he wheeled about with an angry shout,\nHis face and his balls were red.\n\nShe glanced our hero up and down,\nHer tits were proud and high,\nWith utter scorn she glimpsed the horn,\nThat rose from his hairy thigh.\n\nShe blew the smoke from her cigarette,\nOver his steaming knob.\nSo utterly beat was Mexican Pete,\nThat he failed to do his job.\n\nIt was Eskimo Nell who broke the spell,\nIn accents clear and cool:,\n\"You cunt-struck shrimp of a Yankee pimp,\nYou call that a 'kingly tool'?\n\n\"If this here town can't take that down,\"\nShe sneered to those cowering whores,\n\"There's one little cunt that can do the stunt,\nIt's Eskimo Nell's not yours.\"\n\nShe stripped her garments one by one,\nWith an air of conscious pride,\nAnd as she stood in her womanhood,\nThey saw the great divide.\n\nShe seated herself on table top,\nWhere someone had left his glass.\nWith a twitch of her tits she crushed it to bits,\nBetween the two cheeks of her ass.\n\nShe flexed her knees with supple ease,\nAnd spread her legs apart,\nWith a friendly nod to the horny sod,\nShe gave him the cue to start.\n\nBut Dead-eye Dick knew a trick or two,\nHe meant to take his time,\nAnd a girl like this was fucking bliss,\nSo he played the pantomime.\n\nHe flexed his arsehole in an out,\nAnd made his balls inflate,\nUntil they looked like granite knobs,\nOn top of a garden gate.\n\nHe blew his anus inside out,\nHis balls increased in size,\nHis mighty prick grew twice as thick,\nTill it almost reached his eyes.\n\nHe polished it up with alcohol,\nAnd made it steaming hot,\nTo finish the job he sprinkled the knob,\nWith a cayenne pepper pot.\n\nThen neither did he take a run,\nNor did he take a leap,\nNor did he stoop, but took a swoop,\nAnd a steady forward creep.\n\nWith piercing eye he took a sight,\nAlong his mighty tool,\nAnd the steady grin as he pushed it in,\nWas calculatedly cool.\n\nHave you seen the giant pistons,\nOn the might C.P.R.\nWith the driving force of a thousand horse?\nWell, you know what pistons are.\n\nOr you think you do. But you've yet to learn,\nThe ins and outs of the trick,\nOf the work that's done on a non-stop run,\nBy a guy named Dead-eye Dick.\n\nBut Eskimo Nell was no infidel,\nAs good as a whole harem,\nWith the strength of ten in her abdomen,\nAnd the rock of ages between 'em.\n\nShe could take the stream of a lover's cream,\nLike the flush of a water closet,\nAnd she gripped his cock like a Chatswood Lock,\nOn the National Safe deposit.\n\nBut Dead-eye Dick could not come quick,\nHe meant to conserve his powers,\nIf he'd had a mind he'd grind and grind,\nFor a couple of solid hours.\n\nNell lay for a while with a subtle smile,\nThe grip of her cunt grew keener,\nWith a squeeze of her thigh she sucked him dry,\nWith the ease of a vacuum cleaner.\n\nShe performed this trick in a way so slick,\nAs to set in complete defiance,\nThe basic cause and primary laws,\nThat govern sexual science.\n\nShe calmly rode through the phallic code,\nWhich for years had stood the test,\nAnd the ancient rules of the Classic schools,\nIn a second or two went West.\n\nAnd so my friends we come to the end,\nOf copulation's classic,\nThe effect on Dick was sudden and quick,\nAnd akin to an anesthetic.\n\nHe fell to the floor and knew no more,\nHis passions extinct and dead,\nAnd he did not shout as his prick fell out,\nThough 'twas stripped right down to a thread.\n\nThen Mexican Pete jumped to his feet,\nTo avenge his pal's affront,\nWith a jarring jolt he rammed his Colt,\nRight up her gaping cunt.\n\nHe rammed it hard to the trigger guard,\nAnd fired it three plus three,\nBut to his surprise she closed her eyes,\nAnd squealed with ecstasy.\n\nShe jumped to her feet with a smile so sweet,\n\"Bully,\" she said, \"for you.\"\n\"It's hard to believe that was the best,\nThat you poor cunts could do.\n\n\"When next, my friend, that you intend,\nTo sally forth for fun,\nBuy Dead-eye Dick a sugar stick,\nAny yourself an elephant gun.\n\n\"I'm going back to the frozen North,\nWhere the pricks are hard and strong,\nBack to the land of the frozen stand,\nWhere the nights are six months long.\n\n\"It's hard as tin when they put it in,\nIn the land where spunk is spunk,\nNot a trickling stream of lukewarm cream,\nBut a solid frozen chunk.\n\n\"Back to the land where they understand,\nWhat it means to fornicate,\nWhere even the dead sleep two in a bed,\nAnd the babies masturbate.\n\n\"Back to the land of the grinding gland,\nWhere the walrus plays with his prong,\nWhere the polar bear wanks off in his lair,\nThat's where they'll sing this song.\n\n\"They'll tell this tale on the Arctic trail,\nWhere the nights are sixty below,\nWhere it's so damn cold that the Johnnies are sold,\nWrapped up in a ball of snow.\n\n\"In the valley of death with baited breath,\nThat's were they'll sing it too,\nWhere the skeletons rattle in sexual battle,\nAnd the rotting corpses screw.\n\n\"Back to the land where men are men,\nTerra Bellicum,\nAnd there I'll spend my worthy end,\nFor the North is calling: 'Come'.\"\n\nSo Dead-eye Dick and Mexican Pete,\nSlunk out of the Rio Grande,\nDead-eye Dick with his useless prick,\nAnd Pete with no gun in his hand.\n\nYes, when a man grows old and his balls grow cold,\nAnd the end of his tools turns blue,\nAnd the hole in the middle refuses to piddle,\nI'd say he was fucked, wouldn't

Jerusalem.\n\nCHORUS:\nHi Ho Cathusalem,\nCathusalem, Cathusalem,\nHi Ho Cathusalem,\nThe harlot of Jerusalem.\n\nAnd though she fucked for many a year,\nOf pregnancy she had no fear,\nShe washed her passage out with beer,\nThe Best in all Jerusalem.\n\nNow in a hovel by the wall,\nA student lived with but one ball,\nWho'd been though all, or nearly all,\nThe harlots of Jerusalem.\n\nHis phallic art was lean and tall,\nHis phallic art caused all to fall,\nAnd victims lined the wailing wall,\nThat goes around Jerusalem.\n\nOne night returning from a spree,\nWith customary whore-lust he,\nMade up his mind to call and see,\nThe Harlot of Jerusalem.\n\nIt was for her no fortune good,\nThat he should need to root his pud,\nAnd choose her out of all the brood,\nOf harlots in Jerusalem.\n\nFor though he paid his women well,\nThis syphilitic spawn of hell,\nStruck down each year and tolled the bell,\nFor ten harlots of Jerusalem.\n\nForth from the town he took the slut,\nFor 'twas his whim always to rut,\nBy the Salvation Army hut,\nOutside of Old Jerusalem.\n\nWith artful eye and leering look,\nHe took out from its filthy nook,\nHis penis twisted like a crook,\nThe Pride of Old Jerusalem.\n\nHe leaned the whore against the slum,\nAnd tied her at the knee and bum,\nKnowing where the strain would come,\nUpon the fair Cathusalem.\n\nHe seized the harlot by the bum,\nAnd rattling like a Lewis gun,\nHe sowed the seed of many a son,\nInto the fair Cathusalem.\n\nIt was a sight to make you sick,\nTo hear him grunt so fast and quick,\nWhile grinding with his crooked prick,\nThe womb of fair Cathusalem.\n\nThen up there came an Onanite,\nWith warty prick besmeared with shite,\nHe'd sworn that he would goal that night,\nThe harlot of Jerusalem.\n\nHe loathed the art of copulation,\nFor his delight was masturbation,\nAnd with a spurt of cruel elation,\nHe saw the whore Cathusalem.\n\nSo when he saw the grunting pair,\nWith roars of rage he rent the air,\nAnd vowed that he would soon take care,\nOf the harlot of Jerusalem.\n\nUpon the earth he found a stick,\nTo which he fastened half a brick,\nAn took a swipe at the mighty prick\nOf the student of Jerusalem.\n\nHe seized the bastard by his crook,\nWith a single furious look,\nAnd flung him over Kedrun's brook,\nThat babbles past Jerusalem.\n\nThe student gave a furious roar,\nAnd rushed to even up the score,\nAnd with his swollen prick did bore,\nThe cunt of fair Cathusalem.\n\nAnd reeling full of rage and fight,\nHe pushed the bastard Onanite,\nAnd rubbed his face in Cathy's shite,\nThe foulest in Jerusalem.\n\nCathusalem she knew her part,\nShe closed her cunt and blew a fart,\nThat sent him flying like a dart,\nHigh above Old Jerusalem.\n\nAnd buzzing like a bumble bee,\nHe flew straight out towards the sea,\nBut caught his arsehole in a tree,\nThat grows in Old Jerusalem.\n\nAnd to this day you still can see,\nHis arsehole hanging from that tree,\nLet that to you a warning be,\nWhen passing through Jerusalem.\n\nAnd when the moon is bright and red,\nA castrated form sails overhead,\nStill raining curses on the head,\nOf the harlot of Jerusalem.\n\nAs for the student and his lass,\nMany a playful night did pass,\nUntil she joined the V.D. class,\nFor harlots of

Hence the pyramids and the YWCA. Gazelle - This is the pretty little four-footed animal you see on your right, ladies and gentlemen, wot as the peculiarity that every time it leaps from rock to rock it farts, and the scientists are still trying to discover whether it farts because it leaps or whether it leaps because it farts.\n\nThe well-known Ooo-me-goodie Bird - this bird, wot as you will observe if you look carefully at it, has no legs, and is called what is, ladies and gentlemen, because when the male of the species comes in to land, you can hear him cry, you can hear him cry out, \"Oooh me goodies!\"\n\nPlumb-line Bird - this bird spends most of the his time high above the worlds oceans, circling in the breezes until it spies what it is after. Immediately it folds it wings, and dives toward the sea and gathers an ever-increasing momentum until it reaches terminal velocity. At that precise moment it hits the surface of the sea by continues on diving straight down, now with decreasing momentum until, if it has got the timing right, it comes to a stop just behind a sardine which has just farted, whereupon it grabs the bubbles for use in spirit levels.\n\nFamous Oooh-Aaah Bird - the male of this species, ladies and gentlemen resides at the North Pole and the female which leaves at the South Pole and at the appointed season, the male Oooh - Aaah bird flies south from the North pole and the female Ooooh-Aaaah bird flies north from the South Pole until comes the time when they meet at the Equator when you can hear them go,\"oooooooooohhhhhhhhh aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!\"\n\nTri-Angular Iceberg - This is an uncommon sight, ladies and gentlemen, because on one side you will see an Indonesian keeping a private school, on the second side you will see an American keeping a private school, while on the third side you will observe a male polar bear sliding up and down, up and down, keeping his private school.\n\nThe Homosexual Sparrow - this bird is so-called, ladies and gentlemen, because some times it flies backwards for a lark.\n\nThe famous Fuckar-wee Tribe - this tribe, as you will see ladies and gentlemen, is composed of people of small stature - yes sir, short arses, quite right, sir - wot live in the middle of Africa, where the grass grows to an incredible height of 18 feet or more, and all day long the members of this tribe wander through the tall crying, \"Where the Fuck are we? Where the fuck are we?\"\n\nThe Fight between the Snake and the Ostrich - (Please note that this once is only limited by one's imagination, the patience of the audience, and the ability of one's vocal chords to withstand strain. So far the Guineas Book of Records doesn't list the length of the longest known version, but 15 minutes would be considered normal. What follows are the barest details only, embellish them as you will)\n\nIn the left-hand corner, ladies and gentlemen, stands the ostrich (to be followed by a brief life history of the contestant, fight record, size of jock strap, etc), while in the right-hand corner stands the snake (ditto, above). And there, ladies and gentlemen, goes the bell for the first round. (Following is a description of the battle. This round, and each subsequent round should take at least five minutes of fast talking, until finally the snake dives into the ostrich's mouth, wriggles swiftly though its stomach and comes out of it's asshole. Because of this maneuver, the first round goes to the snake. After the applause dies down, Descriptions of subsequent rounds are mainly variations of the first with the snake winning each by the same stratagem. This continues until the final round where the story-teller's art is eliminated at the end of the round when the snake dives into the ostrich's mouth wriggles swiftly through its stomach, and is about to emerge when the ostrich shoves it's beak up its asshole and says, \"Now loop-the-loop, you bastard!\")\n\nThe Tattooed Lady: On the inside of the left thigh she has tattooed Merry Christmas... on the inside of the right thigh she has tattooed Happy New YearŠ and she'd like to invite you to come between the holidays.\n\nThe Female Mathematician: This lovely lady believes this (fingers three inches apart) is twelve inches.\n\nThe Antique Sales Lady: The antique sales lady only sells period furniture - everything has stains on it.\n\nAnother Goddamned Tattooed Lady: This gal has a tattoo of Mike Tyson on one thigh, and a tattoo of George Foreman on the other - and it looks like Don King in the middle.\n\nThe last tattooed lady. This girl has a W tattooed on her left cheek. Another W on her right cheek. When she does cart wheels you can read \"WOW MOM WOW.\"\n\nThe Wild Man from Borneo - The only man in the world without a fundamental orifice. What's that - how does he shit? He doesn't shit. That's what makes him so fucking wild.\n\nPorcupine - His quills are so razor sharp that no living creature dares approach him. How does he fuck? Very carefully, very carefully.","slug":"wild-west-show","tune":"???"},"will-you-marry-me":{"title":"Will You Marry Me","url":"http://www.harrier.net/songbook/W/willyou.html","mainContentPlain":"If I give you half a crown,\nCan I take your knickers down,\nWill you marry, marry, marry, marry, marry,\nWill you marry me?\n\nIf you give me half a crown,\nYour can't take my knickers down,\nYou can't marry, marry, marry, marry, marry,\nYou can't marry me.\n\nIf I give you two-and-six,\nWill you let me squeeze your tits,\nWill you marry, marry, marry, marry, marry,\nWill you marry me?\n\nIf you give me two-and-six,\nI won't let you squeeze my tits,\nYou can't marry, marry, marry, marry, marry,\nYou can't marry me.\n\nIf I give you my big chest,\nAnd all the money I possess,\nWill you marry, marry, marry, marry, marry,\nWill you marry me?\n\nIf you give me your big chest,\nAnd all the money you possess,\nI will marry, marry, marry, marry, marry,\nI will marry you.\n\nGet out of the door, you lousy whore,\nMy money was all you were looking for,\nAnd I'll not marry, marry, marry, marry, marry,\nI'll not marry you.","slug":"will-you-marry-me","tune":"???"},"woodpeckers-song":{"title":"Woodpecker's Song","url":"http://www.harrier.net/songbook/W/woodpecker.html","mainContentPlain":"(Note: This piece has a naval background.
